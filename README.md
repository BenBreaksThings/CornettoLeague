# DRAFT & DRAFT ORDER
- Drafts will be a Live Online Snaking Drafts. Those not in attendance and participating in real time will be subject to Yahoo! autodraft. Maximum participation being the goal, all attempts will be made to facilitate everyone’s participation.
- **(Unlikely to occur again)** For the inaugural keeper season, and should there ever be an extentuation circumstance to reset the entirety of the league's keepers, the draft order will be determined by yahoo’s random assigned order one hour prior to the draft.
- **(Current sustainment cycle)** Following the initial draft, draft order will be determined by reversing the previous year’s standings (e.g., the team that finished first will draft last the following year). 
-	In year’s of expansion or new team additions, new members will be placed at the back of the draft order with previous members taking their draft slots according to previous year’s standings, filling in any gaps.

# KEEPERS
- Keeper quantity is of an incremental growth pattern year over year to enable a legacy growth model. Should there ever be a cause for a complete league reset, the growth model will be bypassed and go direct to the maximum number of keepers. Current growth trajectory:
   - 2020: 2 keepers
   - 2021: 3 keepers
   - 2022: 4 keepers
   - 2023: 5 keepers
   - Every year thereafter: 5 keepers

- Players will be kept for one round less their previous year’s draft value with one round maturation each following year. Once a player reaches past first round eligibility, they would go back into the player pool.
   - **Example:** you draft Ken Dorsey in the 3rd round in 2019. In 2020, he would be your second round selection. In 2021, he would be your first round selection. In 2022, he would return to the draftable player pool.

-	If two players are wanted to be kept for the same round value, a round earlier must be used to secure a player.
   - **Example:** you have two 7th round keepers; you would need to use both your 6th and 7th round picks to keep both players, you determine which player aligns to the 6th and which aligns to the 7th.
-  An open spreadsheet will be kept in this repository for everyone to track the year to year keepers. This will add transparency in who intends to keep which players and inform owners of the status of said players.
- Players picked up from the waiver wire receive a 10th round keeper value, unless they were drafted in that season, in which they will retain their drafted value. For instance, you pick up Marshawn Lynch off the waiver wire. He was not drafted in 2019. For 2020, he would be a 10th round selection. Contrary, if Marshawn Lynch were drafted in the 6th round in 2019, he would cost his team a 5th round selection in 2020.
- There will be a deadline assigned from year to year of when keepers are due. This date will be seven (7) days from the draft.
- Once the season has completed, the free agent pool will lock and no players may be added. Trades from one team to another are allowed however. Please notify the commissioner to adjust rosters via the spreadsheet during the offseaon.

# WAIVERS & FREE AGENTS
- Waivers will be managed by a continual rolling system. Once you use your waiver priority to obtain a player from the waiver wire, you will go to the bottom of the list. 
- Players on the waiver wire will lock at the start of their game and will unlock on Wednesday morning. 
- A free agent period will be active from Wednesday to the start of a player’s game on Thursday, Sunday, or Monday depending on when they play.
- For more information regarding the Yahoo waiver settings, players are encouraged to look into the [Yahoo Waiver FAQ](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN6427.html)

# TRADES
- All accepted trades will be alerted through Yahoo’s alert system. You will need to set your Yahoo account to alert you of trades through your settings. If you need help, please ask.
-  If you feel a trade is unfair or subject to collusion, let the commissioner know. It takes a lot to overturn a trade as the general feeling is that we are all adults playing in this league to enjoy ourselves, not corrupt the process.
- The in season trade deadline will be the be the Friday of Week 10.
- There is a weekly trade deadline of Friday for players involved in the following Sunday/Monday matchups and Wednesday for the following Thursday night matchup.
- If you are wanting to shop a player openly, you may by adding them to your trade block via Yahoo!

# SCHEDULE & PLAYOFFS

- The playoffs will be held in weeks 14, 15, and 16 with six teams competing.
- Division winners will receive automatic bids to the playoffs. The other teams will be based on best finishing.
