# Welcome to the Cornetto Keeper League

This guide will serve as the documentation of rules and how keepers will work before, during, and after each season. The constitution aims to answer questions, eliminate confusion/drama, and makes things as enjoyable as possible.

# ROSTER
A team’s roster will consist of sixteen slots to be filled by a starting roster and bench.

## ROSTER: STARTING ROSTER
| Position                   | Quantity |
|----------------------------|----------|
| Quarterback                | 1        |
| Running Back               | 2        |
| Wide Receiver              | 2        |
| Tight End                  | 1        |
| Wide Receiver/Tight End    | 1        |
| Wide Receiver/Running back | 1        |
| Defense/Special Teams      | 1        |
| Kicker                     | 1        |
	
## ROSTER: BENCH
Each team will have six bench spots that can be used to hold any position players and/or Defense/Special teams.

## ROSTER: INJURED RESERVE
One injured reserve slot per team will be allowed

# SCORING
Scoring values will be stored in the league settings on the service hosting the league. To prevent incongruity between constution remaining up to date and actual scoring values, the tables have been removed from the constitution.

# DRAFT & DRAFT ORDER
- Drafts will be a Live Online Snaking Drafts. Those not in attendance and participating in real time will be subject to autodrafting. Maximum participation being the goal, all attempts will be made to facilitate everyone’s participation.
- Following the initial draft, draft order will be determined by reversing the previous year’s standings (e.g., the team that finished first will draft last the following year). 
- In year’s of expansion or new team additions, new members will be placed at the back of the draft order with previous members taking their draft slots according to previous year’s standings, filling in any gaps.
   - For players replacing previous season players that elected not to return for an additional season, they will adopt the departing player's draft spot.

# KEEPERS
- Keeper quantity is of an incremental growth pattern year over year to enable a legacy growth model. Should there ever be a cause for a complete league reset, the growth model will be bypassed and go direct to the maximum number of keepers. Current growth trajectory:
   - 2020: 2 keepers
   - 2021: 3 keepers
   - 2022: 4 keepers
   - 2023: 5 keepers
   - Every year thereafter: 5 keepers

- Players will be kept for one round less their previous year’s draft value with one round maturation each following year. Once a player reaches past first round eligibility, they would go back into the player pool. Example:
```text
You draft Ken Dorsey in the 3rd round in 2019.
In 2020, he has a second round value/cost.
In 2021, he would be your first round selection.
In 2022, he would return to the draftable player pool.
```
- If two players are wanted to be kept for the same round value, a round earlier must be used to secure a player. Example:
```text
You have two 7th round keepers.
You need to use your 6th & 7th rounds to keep both players.
You choose which player aligns which round.
```
-  An open spreadsheet will be kept for everyone to track the year to year keepers. This will add transparency in who intends to keep which players and inform owners of the status of said players.
- Players picked up from the waiver wire receive a 10th round keeper value, unless they were drafted in that season, in which they will retain their drafted value. For instance, you pick up Marshawn Lynch off the waiver wire. He was not drafted in 2019. For 2020, he would be a 10th round selection. Contrary, if Marshawn Lynch were drafted in the 6th round in 2019, he would cost his team a 5th round selection in 2020.
- There will be a deadline assigned from year to year of when keepers are due. This date will be seven (7) days from the draft.
- Once the season has completed, the free agent pool will lock and no players may be added. Trades from one team to another are allowed however. Please notify the commissioner to adjust rosters via the spreadsheet during the offseaon.

# WAIVERS & FREE AGENTS
- Waivers will be managed by a continual rolling system. Once you use your waiver priority to obtain a player from the waiver wire, you will go to the bottom of the list. 
- Players on the waiver wire will lock at the start of their game and will unlock on Wednesday morning. 
- A free agent period will be active from Wednesday to the start of a player’s game on Thursday, Sunday, or Monday depending on when they play.

# TRADES
- All accepted trades will be alerted through the platform's alert system. Players are responsible for setting their own alerts for trades. If you need help, please ask.
-  If you feel a trade is unfair or subject to collusion, let the commissioner know. Overturning a trade should be rare as the general feeling is that we are all adults playing in this league to enjoy ourselves, not corrupt the process.
- The in season trade deadline will be the be the Friday of Week 10.
- There is a weekly trade deadline of Friday for players involved in the following Sunday/Monday matchups and Wednesday for the following Thursday night matchup.
- If you are wanting to shop a player openly, it is recommended you add them to your `trade block`.

# SCHEDULE & PLAYOFFS
- Each team will play a regular season schedule of thirteen weeks. 
- The playoffs will be held in weeks 14, 15, and 16 with six teams competing.
- Division winners will receive automatic bids to the playoffs. The other teams will be based on best finishing.
